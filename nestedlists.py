# note there is a diff between this :

# xlist =ylist  this pass by reference as change for one change to other unless you didnt change the pointer of one of them
# xlist = ylist[:] here simply just copy the list


#another note

# lists are global variables like when u change in it inside a fun for ex it appear changed  out of the scope of this function
#which is good
